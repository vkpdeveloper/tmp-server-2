It's a delicious addition to salads and perfect for lettuce wraps. Iceberg keeps longer than most other types of lettuce, making it a wise economical choice since it minimizes spoilage and waste.

Grown largely at Trikaya's Ooty farms where the year-round cold weather gives you perfect conditions for growing excellent quality Iceberg.

Iceberg is a variety of lettuce with crisp leaves that grow in a spherical head. It is considered one of the sweeter lettuce varieties like romaine and butterhead. The leaves on the outside tend to be green and the leaves in the center go from pale yellow to nearly white as you move closer to the center of the head.

Known for its mild flavor and firm, crunchy texture, iceberg lettuce is a good choice for salads, shredded in snacks, as a garnish, and on sandwiches. When used in combination with other varieties of lettuce, iceberg lettuce will contribute a pleasant crunch to salads. Moreover, the uniform, pale-green leaves make iceberg lettuce an easy product to work with, so it's a good choice for many recipes, including those that are lightly cooked.",,,20-12-2050,0,0,5,4,1,0,[],0,0,11363|174|172,0
